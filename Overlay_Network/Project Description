Project Description:

This is a model of an overlay network in simulation. 

This simulation displays visually both the ""real" network and the overlay. 

Simulation generates at least 100 nodes for the "real" network. 

Each node of the "real" network must be connected randomly to at least 25% of the other "real" nodes. 

The overlay network must connect every node in a structured manner using super peers. 

These super peers would divide the real network into regions such that there would be one super peer per region. 

The number of super peers is to be entered at runtime and the simulation should permit updates to the number of nodes. 

This simulation should allow the user to request a route between real nodes; and the program should output the route between the nodes for both the real and overlay networks.

The simulation should route from source data work node to a super peer near the source to a super peer near the destination to the destination.
