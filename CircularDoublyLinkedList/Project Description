Project Description for CHORD SYSTEM:

Implementing a working model of CHORD SYSTEM using java. Model must support the addition and deletion of nodes. 

Additional Requirements:

1. Model should start with a single Node.

2. Model should allow the user to interact with the working model to select the function to be accomplished (deletion or addition).

3. Program must provide some visual display of the CHORD SYSTEM. 

4. Specific to the addition function... the function of addition must select a random point in the CHORD to add the new node.

5. The result of the a lookup.

6. CHORD system works by visually showing the "lookup" as it progresses through the algorithm.
